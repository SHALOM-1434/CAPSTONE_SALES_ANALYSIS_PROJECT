# CAPSTONE_SALES_ANALYSIS_PROJECT
This is the project that sharpens the skills I have acquired during my training with the Incubator Hub
## Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis


### Project Overview:
____________________
This project analyzes Capstone Sales Analysis to identify trends, top-performing products, and revenue distribution across different regions and time periods.

**Product Name**: Names or categories of products sold.

**Region:** Geographic regions where sales were recorded.

**Customer Name:** Names of customers making purchases.

**Sales Amount:** Sales values associated with each transaction.

**Date:** Date of each sale to support time-based analysis.



### Technology Stack:
______________________
   •	Spreadsheet Software: [Download Here](https:
   
    1. For data cleaning and Analysis
    2. For data summarization
    3. For data visualization
    
  •	Structured Query Language – For querying the data
  
  •	Power Bi – For creation of reports and interactive visualizations for revenue, product performance and trend analysis.
  



### Key Objectives:
_____________________
  • Calculate total revenue by product to rank top sellers.
  
  •	Visualize sales trends over time and across regions.
  
  •	Identify products with no sales in the last quarter to inform inventory decisions.
  
  •	Create dynamic, shareable visualizations for stakeholder reporting.




### Explolatory Data Analysis:Summarize key metrics, such as the following:
_________________________

  • **Product Sales Distribution**: Plotted charts of Sales per product to see which products sell the most or least.
  
  • **Quantity Sold Analysis:** Analyzed and created visuals of Quantity Sold across products and regions.
  
  •	**Sales Over Time: Plotted** total sales by Order Date or Month to observe trends and seasonality in sales.
  
  • **Sales by Region:** Analyzed and compared total sales across different regions.
  
  •	**Sales By Product:** Analyzed sales by product to see where the most revenue is generated.


  

### Data Analysis:
________________________

This project is designed to answer specific questions to achieve business goals. Such questions are:

**Revenue Analysis:**

•	What is the total revenue per region, per product and over a period of time?

•	Identify the top and bottom revenue generating products:

•	How has revenue changed over time?

**Product Performance Analysis:**

•	Identify products with the highest revenue and sales volumes

•	Which products have little or no sales in the last quarter or year?

•	What is the trend of sales (growth or decline) overtime?

**Regional Sales Analysis:**

•	Identify the regions with most sales

•	Which products sell best in different regions?

•	What is the revenue growth in each region?

### Key Insights and Findings
____________________

#### Top Products:

**Insight**: The "Total Sales by Product" bar chart shows that Shoes generate the highest sales revenue ($613,380), followed by Shirt ($485,600). Other products like Hat and Gloves contribute less significantly.

**Finding**: Shoes and shirts are likely bestsellers, indicating strong customer demand for these items. This insight suggests an opportunity to maintain or increase inventory levels for these products. Additionally, lower-performing products like hats and gloves may need promotional efforts or reevaluation.
  
#### Regional Sales Trends:
  
**Insight**: The "Total Sales by Region" table highlights that the South region accounts for the highest percentage of sales ($927,820) followed by the East region ($485,924). The West and North regions have smaller shares.
  
**Finding**: The South region appears to be the most lucrative market, while the West and North regions show lower sales. This insight could guide regional marketing efforts, suggesting a focus on high-potential regions while exploring ways to improve sales in underperforming regions.
  
#### Total Sales vs. Quantity Sold by Product:

**Insight**: The "Total Sales by Product" chart ranks products by revenue, with Shoes leading in sales ($613,380), followed by Shirt and Hat. However, the "Quantity Sold by Product" chart shows that Hat has the highest quantity sold (15,929 units), despite generating less revenue than Shoes.

**Finding**: This suggests that Shoes have a higher price per unit than Hat, contributing to higher revenue with fewer units sold. Conversely, Hat is sold at a lower price but in high volumes. This insight can guide pricing strategies—highlighting that some products might benefit from price adjustments to balance unit sales with revenue generation.

#### Monthly Sales Trend:
  
**Insight**: The "Monthly Sales Totals for the Current Year" bar chart reveals a notable peak in February (0.2M) and March (0.3M), with a dip in sales from April through August.

**Finding**: The sales peaks in February and March could be due to seasonal demand, promotions, or events driving purchases during these months. This trend indicates potential seasonality in sales, and strategies such as seasonal promotions or inventory adjustments can be planned accordingly.
  
#### Sales Comparison by Month and Year

**Insight**: The "Total Sales by Month & Year" chart compares monthly sales for 2023 and 2024. February 2024 shows a significant spike compared to February 2023, while other months have more stable or lower sales.

**Finding**: The sales growth in February 2024 suggests a successful campaign or a rise in demand during this period compared to 2023. Monitoring these year-over-year changes can help identify the impact of specific promotions, economic conditions, or external factors.

#### Product With No Sales in the Last Quarter:

**Insight**: No Sales Activity: The table shows that products such as Gloves, Hat, Jacket, Shirt, and Shoes recorded no sales in the last quarter. This could indicate reduced demand, seasonal variations, or an issue with inventory availability.

**Finding**: Consistently low-performing products might need to be reconsidered, either for promotional efforts or potential discontinuation if they are not meeting demand.


### Overall Recommendations:
_______________________

Based on these insights, here are some actionable recommendations:

**Pricing Adjustments:** Consider increasing prices slightly for high-demand, lower-priced items like Hat to enhance revenue without significantly impacting demand.

**Inventory Management:** Increase stock of high-demand products like shoes and shirts, especially in the South region, to meet customer demand.

**Promotional Campaigns:** Run targeted campaigns in lower-performing regions like the West and North to increase awareness and sales.
Seasonal Strategy: Prepare for high-demand periods (e.g., February and March) by adjusting inventory and planning marketing campaigns well in advance.

**Year-over-Year Analysis:** Continue monitoring and comparing sales across years to evaluate the success of strategies and adapt to changing customer demands.
